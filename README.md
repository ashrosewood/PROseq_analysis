# PRO-seq Downstream Analysis Tools
Author: Ashley Woodfin

Collection of my downstream analysis scripts to automate PRO-seq and transcriptional pausing analysis.

Precision nuclear run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) is a newer sequencing method from John Lis's lab that allows you to map RNA polymerase II active sites at a single nucleotide resolution. This allows one to find the pausing site within the TSS. These scripts used for various downstream analysis after producing the 3'prime coverage tracks that are either normalized by reads per million or by a spike-in. 

Examples coming soon on the wiki!
